# Geometric Analysis

This repository contains the implementation of various geometric algorithms along with a user-friendly interface for interactive visualization. The project focuses on solving two fundamental problems: checking the intersection of two line segments and finding the convex hull of a set of points.

## Features

1. **Line Segment Intersection:**
   - Orientation test method
   - Relative gradient method
   - Cramer intersect method

2. **Convex Hull Solution:**
   - Brute Force algorithm
   - Jarvis March algorithm
   - Graham Scan algorithm
   - Quick Elimination algorithm
   - Andrew Scan algorithm

3. **Inputs:**
   - Quick file upload
   - Interactive input of geometric objects

4. **Step-by-Step Visualization:**
   - Visualization of each step in the algorithms.
   - Clear demonstration of intersection and convex hull solutions.
